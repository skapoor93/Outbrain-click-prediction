# Outbrain Click Prediction

Using data cleaning/wrangling/analysis predicted the number of clicks on an advertisement provided to the user on the internet. Based on the analysis, we can predict which advertisements the users find relevant to choose and how can we optimize the content of the advertisement. This helps the users seeing relevant advertisements on their web pages and thereby visiting them.
